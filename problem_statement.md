# Problem Statement: Optimizing User Retention, Revenue, and Transaction Insights for a Digital Payment Platform

In todayâ€™s competitive digital payment industry, maintaining a seamless user experience while maximizing transaction value, retaining users, and improving customer engagement are crucial to the success of a platform. 

## Challenges faced by digital payment platforms include:
- Tracking the transaction patterns of users across various time slots and days of the week.
- Understanding the behavior of different age groups in terms of transaction value.
- Identifying high-value users and distinguishing between new, retained, and churned users.
- Monitoring user retention rates and accurately identifying reasons for churn.
- Calculating and improving the revenue per transaction for both new and returning users.
- Visualizing user engagement through user funnel stages, from total users to those who have completed transactions.

The need for an analytical tool that provides deep insights into user transactions, revenue generation, user retention, and behavior patterns across various demographics is evident. A clear and interactive dashboard solution would allow for informed decision-making based on real-time data.
